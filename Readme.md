#### Ansible playbook commands:
* ansible-playbook launch_vpc.yml --extra-vars "env={{companyName}}"
* ansible-playbook launch_instance.yml --extra-vars "env={{companyName}} slice=build instance_name=JenkinsServer"
* ansible-playbook launch_instance.yml --extra-vars "env={{companyName}} slice=build instance_name=TestMachine1"
